----------------------
--- Operating mode ---
----------------------

This software can run in NES controller mode or in SNES controller mode. 
The mode is selected via pin PORTB1 (JP1). If connected to ground, the 
software operates in NES mode. 

The operating mode can be forced to NES mode by holding the start
button down at power-up. (When you turn on your console or when you
connect the adapter to an already running console).

When NES mode is forced on with an SNES controller, the A-B buttons
become B and Y. NES games are almost unplayable with an SNES 
controller unless running in this mode. See mapping below for
details.

If a NES controller is used, the A and B buttons can also be
swapped by holding A and B down at power up.

-------------------------
---- Button mapping: ----
-------------------------

Snes controller:
- Snes Start -> Gamecube Start
- Snes Select -> Gamecube Z
- Snes Left,Right,Up,Down -> Gamecube Left,Right,Up,Down
- Snes Y -> Gamecube Y
- Snes X -> Gamecube X
- Snes B -> Gamecube B
- Snes A -> Gamecube A
- Snes L -> Gamecube L
- Snes R -> Gamecube R

Nes controller:
- Nes Start -> Gamecube Start
- Nes Select -> Gamecube Z
- Nes Left,Right,Up,Down -> Gamecube Left,Right,Up,Down
- Nes B -> Gamecube B*
- Nes A -> Gamecube A*

* A and B will be inverted if the adapter was powerd up holding
A and B down.

Snes controller in NES mode: (hold start at power-up)
- Snes Start -> Gamecube Start
- Snes Select -> Gamecube Select
- Snes Left,Right,Up,Down -> Gamecube digital Left,Right,Up,Down
- Snes Y -> Gamecube B
- Snes B -> Gamecube A

Notice the only peculiarity is that the Snes SELECT button is 
mapped to the Gamecube's Z button. There's no select button on a
gamecube controller...


---------------------------
--- Button combinations ---
---------------------------

Here are special button combinations which sends
button presses or analog axes events that are normally 
impossible on a regular NES or SNES controller due to the
lower number of buttons and missing analogic sticks. These
combinations are useful to get back to emulator menus.

Snes mode:
	- L+R+Select+left	-> Cstick right

Nes mode:
	- A+B+Select+left	-> Cstick right
	- A+B+Select+up		-> L+R
