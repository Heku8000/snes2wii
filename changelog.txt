Version 1.5.1 : 2016-03-26
	- Fixed a long standing bug where random button press would occur when no
	  controller (NES/SNES) was present.
	- Corrected fuse values in Atmega168 makefile

Version 1.5 : 2016-02-07
	- Add ATmega168 support

Version 1.4.1: 2015-05-09
	- Lowered latency by polling the SNES/NES controller more frequently.

Version 1.4: 2015-04-25
    - Source code updates for newer compilers
	- Fix the value sent by to simulate C-Stick right moves.

Version 1.3: 2013-05-22
	- Added a feature to swap the NES A and B buttons. Hold A and B at power up to
	use it.

Version 1.2:
	- Fixed a small deviation from the "normal" controller protocol which
	  _could_ have caused incompatibility with some games.
    - Code improvements.

Version 1.1:
	- NES mode can be forced on by holding the Start button at power-up. Without
	  this, I consider NES games almost unplayable using an SNES controller.
	- Implemented button combinations which can affect how unaccessible
 	  Gamecube buttons and sticks are reported. eg: Sending L+R pressed with
	  a NES controller, and sending 'CStick towards the right'. See
	  mappings.txt for details.
	- Implemented new Gamecube commands for better compatibility, eg: GCLinux

Version 1.0:
	- Initial relase. 
	- Supports NES and Snes controllers (selected by io pin)
