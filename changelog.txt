Version 1.1:
	- NES mode can be forced on by holding the Start button at power-up. Without
	  this, I consider NES games almost unplayable using an SNES controller.
	- Implemented button combinations which can affect how unaccessible
 	  Gamecube buttons and sticks are reported. eg: Sending L+R pressed with
	  a NES controller, and sending 'CStick towards the right'. See
	  mappings.txt for details.
	- Implemented new Gamecube commands for better compatibility, eg: GCLinux

Version 1.0:
	- Initial relase. 
	- Supports NES and Snes controllers (selected by io pin)
